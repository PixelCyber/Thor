### What personal information we collect or access

- Since Anubis is a local developer tool, you can view, delete or share test records as you need. Data will not upload anywhere, it's just stored in app local under your full control.

- Anubis will ask you for album accesssing, when you read data from album to build a request.


Anubis may update its Privacy Policy from time to time. When we change the policy in a material way, a notice will be posted in app along with the updated Privacy Policy.

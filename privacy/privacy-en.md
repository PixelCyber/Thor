### What personal information we collect or access

- Your app receipt: Thor may request an app purchased receipt validation, it request App Store to verify the legal purchase state of your app to avoid a pirated app or jailbreak device. 

- Thor is a HTTP sniffer, a source of HTTP traffics will be necessary. Thor used a VPN tunnel to set up a source of HTTP traffics from both Wi-Fi and cellular of local device. All traffics just forwarded to their original destination addresses with local HTTP proxy (not any remote proxy) in Thor. You can view, delete or share the recorded traffic data as you need. Data will not upload anywhere, it's just stored in app local under your full control.

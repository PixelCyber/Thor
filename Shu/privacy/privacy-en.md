# Shu Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to Shu. 

All files open in Shu were stored in app local only, no data will be uploaded to remote server. (Even Shu doesn't have a remote server or something like that, it's totally a local file viewer.).

Shu will not record or upload any user behavior statistics.

### What personal information we collect or access

- Since Shu is a File Viewer, you can view, delete or share files as you need. Data will not upload anywhere, it's just stored in app local under your full control.

- Shu will ask you for album accesssing, when you save data to album.


Shu may update its Privacy Policy from time to time. When we change the policy in a material way, a notice will be posted in app along with the updated Privacy Policy.
